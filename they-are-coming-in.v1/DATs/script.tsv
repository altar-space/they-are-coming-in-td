Scrip - I’ll cover
Scrip - I’m gonna keep watch

Cup - Pop you lost 20% but we found 30%

Pop - I don’t want to be rude but you have more % than me
Pop - Maybe Gabu Flip and Sip could donate some % to me?
Pop - Chuck me 2%

Sud - I like the % as it is

Gabu - Sorry it’s just kinda rigged to have more than 100%

Scrip - wait what the…

Sud - I just kind of like having an extra 5%
Sud - In case they get in and take some
Sud - But I would consider giving like 2% back

Sip - Okay I'm back with supplies
Sip - WTF
Sip - THEY'RE EVERYWHERE

Sip - Who was watching???
Sip - They all got in

Cup - What do we do with the extra %

Scrip - Sorry I was watching but started thinking about the %
Scrip - All of them are now in

Cup - Who's over 100%?

Sip - They are all inside

Sud - All of them?

Pop - Get them out!!!

Scrip - All of them are now inside

Sud - Surely they aren’t all in?

Flip - There’s heaps more they’re not coming in yet but they’re about to come in

Sip - Maybe we should get out and leave them in??

Pop - Friggin hell GET THEM OUT

Sud - I can’t see any at the south entrance

Sip - No wait

Gabu - If you all would have just figured out the % they wouldn’t have come in

Sip - Maybe we should get out

Pop - Ok who is going to talk to them

Gabu - I just can’t believe Scrip could betray us

Sud - I can believe it. Scrip told me that leaving was a trap to get all the %
Sud - But I sort of thought Scrip was talking about something else

Gabu -  Should we get all the % back?

Sud - Just half

Flip - Just half
Flip - Even though Scrip took it we can’t take it all it’s not fair

Sip - Yes

Pop - I’m sad

Sud - But me dunno which

Gabu - Wait is scrip innocent?
Gabu - Scrip…
